### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Vitor BrandÃ£o** and I'm a **software developer student** at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). 

Here are some of the programming skills I've been learning since 2020 on this ongoing process:

As you can see, I am aiming to be a Full-Stack Developer, since I'm studying both Front and Back-End. 
Make yourself at home and feel free to search about this skills in my Repositories, because I imagine that to you, as a GitHub user, codes  explain better than words.
