### Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Vitor BrandÃ£o** and I'm a **software developer student** at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). 

I'm brazilian and here are some of the programming skills I've been learning since 2020 on this ongoing process:

As you can see, I am aiming to be a **Full-Stack Developer**, since I'm studying both **Front-End** and **Back-End**. 

Make yourself at home and feel free to search about this skills in my Repositories, because I imagine that to you, as a GitHub user, *codes explain better than words*.
